PHP Module, Package & Program Loader
====================================

*Status: DEV* - **WORK IN PROGRESS: YOU MAY GET FRUSTRATED TRYING THIS!**

The PINF PHP Loader combines what you would traditionally call a **package installer** and 
**class loader** and is **intended to be used as the core to all your PHP applications**.

The loader allows for bootstrapping a state-of-the-art, consistent and portable modular environment
for PHP with the ability to load third party PHP packages from PEAR and other communities following
typical PHP class naming conventions.

The loader brings [CommonJS Packages/1.1 (draft)](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1), 
[CommonJS Packages/Mappings/C (proposal)](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/Mappings/C) and further concepts to the PHP platform.

For more information about the direction this loader is taking see the [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js).
